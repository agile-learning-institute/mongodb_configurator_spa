# Cypress E2E Implementation Plan

This plan replaces the initial brainstorm with a concrete, phased approach for adding Cypress E2E tests to the SPA. Each phase lists review gates (where you review before we continue) and commit checkpoints (work we will complete and commit without a review gate between steps).

Base assumptions:
- SPA runs at `http://localhost:8082`. Use `npm run service` to start/reset API, SPA, and test data to a known state.
- We will prefer real backend interactions. We will only stub network calls when stability requires it.

## Phase 0 â€” Foundations and Conventions (Review Gate)
Goals: Ensure predictable environments and testability hooks.
 - Define test stability conventions:
  - Use existing `data-test` attributes for unambiguous selectors; prefer semantic roles/text first. Add more `data-test` only when necessary.
  - Avoid arbitrary fixed waits. Use assertions that inherently wait (e.g., `should('be.visible')`, `contains`), or explicit waits on route aliases.
 - Confirm/reset data flow: `npm run service` is verified to fully reset the system to a known starting state for specs.

Deliverables:
- Short list of UI elements that need `data-testid` to avoid brittle selectors (we will add them incrementally in later phases as needed).

Review Gate: Confirm conventions and agree on the minimal `data-test` additions list.

## Phase 1 â€” Tooling Setup (Commit Checkpoints)
- [x] Install dependencies:
   - `devDependencies`: `cypress` (and `eslint-plugin-cypress` optional). `typescript` already present in repo.
- [x] Add npm scripts to `package.json`:
   - `cy:open`: `cypress open`
   - `cy:run`: `cypress run`
   - `e2e`: `npm run service && cypress run --browser chrome`
- [x] Create `cypress.config.ts` with:
   - `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8082'`
   - `viewportWidth/Height` reasonable defaults
   - `video: true` for CI, screenshots on failure
- [x] Add Cypress TypeScript support:
   - `cypress/tsconfig.json` extending repo tsconfig with DOM and Cypress types
- [x] Scaffolding:
   - `cypress/e2e/` for specs
   - `cypress/fixtures/` for small JSON payloads (if needed)
   - `cypress/support/commands.ts` for custom commands
   - `cypress/support/e2e.ts` for global hooks and route aliases
- [x] Smoke test:
   - `app.smoke.cy.ts`: open `/`, assert title/primary navigation renders.

Commit after each step (1â€“6) with focused messages.

## Phase 2 â€” Utilities and Stability (Commit Checkpoints)
- [x] Add a custom command `cy.resetApp()` that runs before each spec to ensure a clean state. Given `npm run service` is reliable, we may call it once before the run and ensure specs are independent; `cy.resetApp()` can be a no-op hook or perform lightweight checks.
- [x] Add helpers:
   - `cy.getByTest(id)` convenience selector for `data-test`
   - Route alias helpers for common API calls if needed (e.g., `@getList`, `@saveItem`)
- [x] Document selector strategy inside `cypress/support/README.md`.

Commit after each utility addition.

## Phase 3 â€” Page-Level E2E: Migrations (Review Gate after spec is green)
- [x] Specs: `cypress/e2e/migrations.cy.ts`
- [x] Precondition: `cy.resetApp()` to ensure starting state
- [x] Navigate to `/migrations`
- [x] Verify starting list state
- [x] Create: click New â†’ enter name `test-migration`
- [x] Assert URL `/migrations/test-migration.json`
- [x] Verify empty list
- [x] Add migration entries: add `{"foo":"bar"}`, then `{"far":"boo"}`; verify both appear
- [x] Delete first entry; verify only `{"far":"boo"}` remains
- [x] Reload; verify persistence
- [x] Delete the document; assert redirect to `/migrations` and absence of `test-migration.json`

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Migrations spec is green and covers full CRUD flow with persistence verification.

## Phase 4 â€” Page-Level E2E: Test Data (Commit Checkpoints)
- [x] Specs: `cypress/e2e/test_data.cy.ts`
- [x] Mirror migrations flow for `/test_data`
- [x] Create `test-data`, add two JSON docs, delete one, verify persistence and final deletion

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Test Data spec is green and mirrors the successful migrations flow with minimal adaptation.

## Phase 5 â€” Page-Level E2E: Enumerators âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Specs: `cypress/e2e/enumerators.cy.ts`
- [x] Basic CRUD
  - [x] `/enumerators` â†’ New â†’ assert URL and default Version (e.g., 3) and unlocked state
  - [x] Add value with name/description; verify display
  - [x] Add an enumeration and values; verify in list and detail after reload
  - [x] Lock â†’ assert locked; Unlock â†’ assert unlocked
  - [x] Delete and confirm â†’ back to list; verify file (e.g., `enumerations.3.yaml`) absent
- [ ] Versioning rules (Future enhancement)
  - [ ] Creating a new version locks the previous
  - [ ] Cannot delete old version
  - [ ] Cannot unlock old version
  - [ ] Create new version via unlock dialog

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented E2E tests for Enumerators page including:
- List page loading and baseline enumerator verification
- Detail page navigation and element verification  
- Adding and editing enumerations with proper API waiting and page refresh
- Using reliable selectors and proper test isolation with before/after hooks

## Phase 6 â€” Page-Level E2E: Types âœ… COMPLETE
Goal: Core navigation + representative CRUD for Types page. Focus on one happy path, avoiding over-specification.
- [x] Specs: `cypress/e2e/types.cy.ts`
- [x] Visit `/types`, create a minimal type, verify save, reload persistence, delete

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented E2E tests for Types page including:
- Type creation via dialog with proper redirection handling
- Detail page navigation and element verification
- Complete lock/unlock flow with confirmation dialogs
- Type deletion with proper unlock handling and confirmation

## Phase 7 â€” Page-Level E2E: Dictionaries âœ… COMPLETE
Goal: Core navigation + representative CRUD for Dictionaries page.
- [x] Specs: `cypress/e2e/dictionaries.cy.ts`
- [x] Visit `/dictionaries`, create dictionary with one entry, verify, delete

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented E2E tests for Dictionaries page including:
- List page loading and baseline dictionary verification
- Detail page navigation and element verification
- Dictionary creation via dialog with proper redirection handling
- Complete lock/unlock flow with confirmation dialogs
- Dictionary deletion with proper unlock handling and confirmation

## Phase 8 â€” Page-Level E2E: Configurations âœ… COMPLETE
Goal: Core navigation + representative CRUD for Configurations page.
- [x] Specs: `cypress/e2e/configurations.cy.ts`
- [x] Visit `/configurations`, create configuration referencing existing types/dictionaries if required, verify, delete
- [x] Enhanced version control testing with patch logic validation

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented E2E tests for Configurations page including:
- List page loading and baseline configuration verification
- Detail page navigation and element verification
- Configuration creation via complex dialog with version control validation
- Complete version patch logic testing (major increments reset minor/patch, minor increments reset patch)
- Version validation (Create button disabled until version > 0.0.0)
- Complete lock/unlock flow with confirmation dialogs
- Configuration deletion with proper unlock handling and confirmation
- Multi-file cleanup (config, dictionary, test data)

## Phase 9 â€” Cross-Page User Journey (Review Gate)
Spec: `cypress/e2e/journey.basic.cy.ts`
- From an empty state, create required prerequisites (enumerator/type/dictionary)
- Create a configuration that uses them
- Verify downstream pages reflect the created entities
- Clean up by deleting entities in reverse order (if allowed)

Review Gate: Validate the journey aligns with real-world usage.

## Phase 10 â€” Hardening and Flake Reduction (Commit Checkpoints)
- Replace any brittle selectors with `data-testid`
- Add route-level waits for critical POST/PUT operations using `cy.intercept`
- Add retries-on-failure in CI via Cypress config or `cypress-grep` (optional)
- Increase assertion specificity where needed

Commit small refactors as we harden specs.

## Phase 11 â€” CI Integration (Review Gate)
- Add CI job that runs: `npm ci`, `npm run service` (background), wait for health, `npm run e2e`
- Store videos/screenshots as CI artifacts
- Optional: add `cypress-grep` tags to allow smoke vs. full runs

Review Gate: Approve CI config and pass criteria for merges.

---

Notes and Working Agreements
- We keep specs independent and idempotent; any created data must be uniquely named (timestamp or GUID suffix) and cleaned up when feasible.
- Prefer visible UI state assertions over DOM structure assertions.
- Only introduce API stubbing when the real system cannot be made stable or reasonably performant for the scenario.
